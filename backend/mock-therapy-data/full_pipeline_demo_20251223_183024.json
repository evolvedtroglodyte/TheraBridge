They describe losing the anticipated parental relationship and experiencing anger, but also small yet important positive signals: occasional relief at not having to pretend and explicit self-acceptance (happy with who I am, in therapy). They show somatic signs of depression (chest tightness, exhaustion, decreased appetite) and pervasive rumination about family dynamics and future outcomes (What if they never come around?). There is no active suicidal ideation or plan, but the expressed hopelessness about parental acceptance and the sense of loss indicate significant distress that is not easily managed. The presence of supportive moments (Jordan\u2019s support) introduces a glimmer of resilience, preventing the score from being in the severe range.",
