They describe emotional states such as grief (\u201cGrief. Like, I'm grieving the parents I thought I had.\u201d), guilt (\u201cI feel so guilty. Like I broke our family.\u201d), and anger (\u201cI am so angry. I\u2019m furious.\u201d), alongside fear about ongoing rejection (\u201cWhat if they never come around? What if I just lost my family because I wanted to be honest?\u201d). These are coupled with somatic distress (chest tightness), and disruption in appetite, though sleep is surprisingly preserved. There are also positive, protective signals: moments of relief about not having to pretend anymore, and active support from Jordan (\u201cJordan was amazing\u2026 they held me while I cried\u201d; \u201cI\u2019m happy with who I am\u201d). The absence of active suicidal ideation is noted, but the overall tone remains distressed with significant emotional fluctuation and concern about family relationships. The blend of severe distress with some hopeful/relief signals places the mood in a mid-range with substantial distress but not crisis-level (no SI/plan).",
