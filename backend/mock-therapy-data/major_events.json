The relationship ended because Jamie felt overwhelmed by Alex's panic attacks and emotional intensity. This event is referenced frequently in early sessions as Alex processes grief and attachment wounds."

The ADHD diagnosis helped Alex understand why they'd developed such harsh self-criticism and why previous relationship partners (including Jamie) had labeled them as 'careless' or 'unreliable'. This insight was transformative for Alex's self-concept."

For the first time in their life, they experienced what 'normal' executive function felt like - being able to start tasks without hours of dread, sustaining attention on boring-but-necessary work, and remembering appointments without elaborate backup systems. This created a grief response (mourning what life could have been with earlier diagnosis) alongside relief and hope."

The conflict also revealed the conditional nature of parental support - love tied to academic success and conformity to family expectations. This moment was particularly painful because Alex had to defend their need for therapy while hiding their non-binary identity."

The Portland trip (and enjoying it solo) challenged that core belief. It also marked the first time Alex's depression had lifted enough to engage in spontaneous joy and social connection. The trip occurred during a period when ADHD medication was working well and mindfulness practice was becoming a daily habit."

On the other hand, the relationship triggered Alex's anxious attachment - fear of abandonment, people-pleasing, and difficulty setting boundaries. The key difference from past relationships is that Alex now recognizes these patterns and has tools (DBT skills, therapy support) to work through them rather than letting anxiety dictate behavior."

The coming out did not go as hoped - parents reacted with shock, denial, and silence rather than acceptance. However, Alex demonstrated remarkable resilience: they did NOT spiral into suicidal ideation (unlike the breakup 4 months prior), they activated their support network immediately, and they held onto their values despite family rejection. The experience was painful but also validating - Alex survived what they'd feared was 'unsurvivable' and discovered their identity doesn't depend on parental approval."
