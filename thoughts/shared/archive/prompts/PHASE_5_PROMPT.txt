I need to continue Phase 5 of the TherapyBridge dashboard implementation.

**Context:**
- Phase 4 (frontend) is COMPLETE and deployed: Session cards show "Analyzing..." placeholders immediately
- Backend has 2 database column fixes deployed, 1 pending
- Backend currently BLOCKED by stuck Wave 2 process - demo init timing out after 120 seconds

**Comprehensive Plan:**
See `thoughts/shared/plans/2026-01-01-phase-5-backend-database-fixes.md`

**Current Status:**
See `.claude/CLAUDE.md` lines 111-117 for blocker details

**Your tasks:**
1. Fix Wave 2 `deep_analysis` → `prose_analysis` column mismatch in `backend/scripts/seed_wave2_analysis.py`
2. Restart Railway backend to kill stuck process
3. Test full flow: fresh demo → cards with placeholders → Wave 1 completes → data appears
4. Verify no database errors in Railway logs
5. Confirm all 10 sessions get Wave 1 data within 60-90 seconds

**Success criteria:**
- Demo init completes in 30-40 seconds (not timeout)
- Session cards load in 3-5 seconds with "Analyzing..." placeholders
- Polling detects Wave 1 completion and updates cards
- Railway logs show no column mismatch errors
- All database writes succeed

Start by reading the comprehensive plan, then proceed with Task 1 (fix Wave 2 column).
