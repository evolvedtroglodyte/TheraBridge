However, the session shows significant emotional shift as therapist reframes ADHD symptoms from character flaws to treatable medical condition. Patient moves from self-blame ('I'm lazy', 'bad at life') to relief and cautious hope ('maybe I'm not fundamentally broken'). The breakthrough realization that untreated ADHD contributes to depression represents a major cognitive shift, evidenced by emotional response ('literally about to cry', 'it's relief'). Despite ongoing struggles, the session ends with concrete treatment planning and renewed hope.",

This represents a fundamental identity shift from 'I'm bad at life' to 'I have a treatable neurological condition.' The therapist's psychoeducation about untreated ADHD causing depression symptoms triggers an emotional breakthrough, with patient recognizing years of misdirected self-blame and shame. Patient moves from minimizing ADHD ('it's whatever') to understanding it as central to their mental health challenges. This cognitive reframing opens the door to treatment and self-compassion.",
      "evidence": "Patient's statements: 'Wait, really? Like this isn't just me being bad at life?' followed by 'Oh my god. That's... I never connected those things. Like I always thought the depression was making me unable to focus, not the other way around.' and emotional response: 'I'm literally about to cry right now. Like this is the first time anyone has said it's not my fault.' The breakthrough culminates in: 'Like maybe I'm not fundamentally broken. Maybe there's actually something that can help.' Patient shifts from resistance to ADHD treatment to active engagement in psychiatric referral planning."
