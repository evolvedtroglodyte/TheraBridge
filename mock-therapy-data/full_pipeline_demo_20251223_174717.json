At the same time, there are hopeful signals: relief at living authentically and strong support from Jordan. They are engaged in the session and able to articulate experiences, though they report physical symptoms (chest tightness, fatigue) and sleep is variable. No active suicidal ideation is reported, but the outlook is emotionally heavy with ambivalence about the future, placing the overall mood in a mid-range distress level with protective factors.",

They describe \u201cfeels like freedom\u201d and that they can observe grief without being overwhelmed, indicating better emotional regulation. They acknowledge ongoing fears and some days are hard, and they still seek to manage expectations about parental acceptance, but frame progress as real and achievable: \u201cI survived,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m making choices,\u201d and \u201cI have some control here.\u201d Importantly, there is no active suicidal ideation or self-harm intention reported.

Notable signals include: acceptance of a paper with first-author credit and elation about achievement, reduced pervasive anxiety in relationships (able to use grounding techniques and rely less on compulsive messaging), and medication optimization linked to improved focus and reduced forgetfulness. There is strong evidence of improved sleep, regular exercise, and adherence to sleep hygiene, all contributing to energy and mood. Social engagement has increased (mentoring queer students, more time with friends), and relational dynamics with Jordan and family have become more positive, including meaningful parental acknowledgment. They describe a sense of meaning and purpose from mentoring and identity integration. Importantly, they acknowledge vulnerability to relapse and still experience some anxiety about maintaining gains, but they also demonstrate proactive coping plans (reaching out to supports, continuing medications, keeping therapy appointments, and maintaining routines). Overall, mood is elevated with hopeful, energized functioning, tempered by realism about potential setbacks.",
