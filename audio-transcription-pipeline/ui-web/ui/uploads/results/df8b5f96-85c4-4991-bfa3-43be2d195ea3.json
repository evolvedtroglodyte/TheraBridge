  "full_text": "personal and unique effort to sit in on is ordinarily a very private therapeutic experience. An actual patient is courageous enough, considerate enough, to allow herself to be photographed, actually engaged in therapy with three different therapists. We are allowed the privilege of seeing and feeling what really transpires. A film series like this, three therapists distinguished by their different orientations, share their therapeutic endeavors, has never been made before. We therefore wish to express our gratitude to Gloria, the patient, and to her therapists for allowing us to share in their therapeutic adventure. This series will be divided into three separate films. In the first film, we see Dr. Carl Rogers, founder of Client-Centered Therapy, interviewing Gloria. In film number two, Dr. Frederick Pearls, founder of Gestalt Therapy, is working with her. And in film number three, Dr. Albert Ellis, founder of Rational Emotive Therapy, is our therapist. Each therapist will first describe his system of therapy briefly. He will then demonstrate his work with Gloria, and then he will comment briefly on his work. Now, here's Dr. Carl Rogers. From my own years of therapy, I've been a therapist. I've been a therapist for a long time. I've been a therapist for a long time. From my own therapeutic experience, I've come to feel that if I can create the proper climate, the proper relationship, the proper conditions, a process of therapeutic movement will almost inevitably occur in my client. And I ask, what is this climate? What are these conditions? Will they exist in the interview with the woman I'm about to talk with and who I've never seen before? Let me try to describe very briefly what these conditions are as I see them. First of all, one question is, can I be real in the relationship? This has come to have an increasing amount of importance to me over the years. I feel that genuineness is another way of describing the quality I would like to have. I like the term congruence, by which I mean that what I'm experiencing inside is present in my awareness and comes out through my communication. In a sense, when I have this quality, I'm all in one piece in the relationship. There's another word that describes it for me. I feel that in the relationship, I would like to have a transparency. I would be quite willing for my client to see all the way through me, that there would be nothing, nothing hidden. And when I'm real in this fashion that I'm trying to describe, then I know that my own feelings will often bubble up into awareness and be expressed, but be expressed in ways that won't impose themselves on my client. Then the second question I would have is, will I find myself prizing this person, caring for this person? I certainly don't want to pretend a caring that I don't feel. In fact, if I dislike my client persistently, I feel it's better that I should express it. But I know that non-possessive therapy is much more likely to occur, and constructive change is much more likely, if I feel a real spontaneous prizing of this individual with whom I'm working. A prizing of this person as a separate individual. You can call that quality acceptance. You can call it caring. You can call it a non-possessive love, if you wish. I think any of those terms tend to describe it. I know that the relationship will prove more constructive if it's present. Then the third quality, will I be able to understand the inner world of this individual from the inside? Will I be able to see it through her eyes? Will I be able to be sufficiently sensitive to move around inside the world of her feelings so that I know what it feels like to be her, so that I can sense not only the surface of her feelings, but some of the meanings that lie somewhat underneath the surface? I know that if I can let myself sensitively and accurately enter into her world of experience, then change and therapeutic movement are much more likely. Well, suppose I am fortunate in that I do experience some of these attitudes in the relationship. What then? Well, then a variety of things are likely to happen. Both from my clinical experience and from our research investigations, we find that if attitudes of the sort that I've described are present, then quite a number of things will happen. She'll explore some of her feelings and attitudes more deeply. She's likely to discover some hidden aspects of herself that she wasn't aware of previously. Feeling herself prized by me, it's quite possible she'll come to prize herself more. Feeling that some of her meanings are understood by me, then she can more readily perhaps listen to herself, listen to what's going on within her own experience, listen to some of the meanings she hasn't been able to catch before. And perhaps if she senses a realness in me, she'll be able to be a little more real within herself. I suspect there will be a change in the manner of her expression. At least, this has been my experience. in other instances. From being rather remote from her experiencing, remote from what's going on within her, it's possible that she'll move toward more immediacy of experiencing. That she will be able to sense and express what's going on in her in the immediate moment. From being disapproving of herself, it's quite possible she will move toward a greater degree of acceptance of herself. From somewhat of a fear of relating, she may move toward being able to relate more directly and to encounter me more directly. From construing life in somewhat rigid black and white patterns, she may move toward more tentative ways of construing her experience and of seeing the meanings in it. From a locus of evaluation, which is outside of herself, it's quite possible she will move toward recognizing a greater capacity within herself for making judgments and drawing conclusions. So those are some of the changes that we have seen. If I have any success in creating the kind of conditions that I described initially, then we may be able to see some of these changes in this client, even though I know in advance that our contact is going to be very brief. Good morning. Hello, Dr. Rogers. I'm Dr. Rogers. You must be Gloria. Yes, I am. Let's have a chair. We have half an hour together, and I really don't know what we'll be able to make of it. But I hope we can make it. I'd be glad to know whatever concerns you. Well, right now I'm nervous, but I feel more comfortable the way you're talking in a low voice, and I don't feel like you'll be so harsh on me. I hear the tremor in your voice. Well, the main thing I want to talk to you about is I'm just newly divorced, and I had gone in therapy before, and I felt comfortable when I left. And all of a sudden now, the biggest change is adjusting to my single life. And one of the things that bother me the most is especially men and having men to the house and how it affects the children. And the biggest thing I want, the thing that keeps coming to my mind I want to tell you about is I have a daughter, 9, who at one time I felt I had a lot of emotional problems. And I wish I could stop shaking. And I'm real conscious of things affecting her. I don't want her to get upset. I don't want to shock her. I want something to change. I don't want her to feel bad for her to accept me. And we're real open with each other, especially about sex. And the other day, she saw a girl that was single but pregnant, and she asked me all about can girls get pregnant if they're single. And the conversation was fine, and I wasn't at ease at all with her until she asked me if I'd ever made love to a man since I left her daddy. And I lied to her. And ever since then, it keeps coming up to my mind because I feel so guilty lying to her because I never lie, and I want her to trust me. And I almost want an answer from you. I want you to tell me. What will affect her wrong if I told her the truth or what? And it's this concern about her and the fact that you really aren't, that this open relationship that has existed between you and I, you feel is kind of... Yes, I feel like I have to be on guard about that because I remember when I was a little girl when I first found out my mother and father made love. It was dirty and terrible, and I didn't like her anymore for a while. And I don't want to lie to Pammy either, and I don't know... And you sure wish I could give you the answer as to what you should tell her. I was afraid you were going to say that. Because what you really want is an answer. I want to especially know if it would affect her, if I was completely honest and open with her, or if it would affect her because I lied. I feel like it's bound to make a strain because I lied to her. So she'll suspect that or she will know something's not quite right. I feel that inside she'll distrust me, yes. And also I thought what she would about when she gets a little older and she finds herself in touchy situations. She probably wouldn't want to admit it to me because she thinks I'm so good and so sweet. And yet I'm afraid she could think I'm really angry. That she could think I'm really a devil. And I want so bad for her to accept me. And I don't know how much a nine-year-old can take. And really both alternatives concern you. That she might think you're too good or better than you really are. Yes. And she might think that you're worse than you are. Not worse than I am. I don't know if she can accept me the way I am. I think I paint a picture that I'm all sweet and motherly. And I'm a little ashamed of my shady side too. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I see. It really cuts a little deeper. If she really knew you, would she, could she accept you? This is what I don't know, yes. I don't want her to turn away from me. Mm-hmm. I don't know how I feel about it because there are times when I feel so guilty. Like when I have a man over. I even try to make a special setup so that if I were ever alone with him, the children would never catch me and that sort of thing. Mm-hmm. Because I'm real leery about it. Mm-hmm. And yet I also know I have these desires. So it's quite clear. It's not only her problem or the relationship with her. It's in you as well. And my guilt. Yeah. Yeah. I feel guilty so often. What can I accept myself as doing? Yes. Yes. And you realize that you set up sort of subterfuges so as to make sure that you're not caught or something. You realize that you are acting from guilt, is that? Yes. Mm-hmm. I don't like the way, I would like to feel comfortable with whatever I do. If I choose not to tell Pammy the truth, to feel comfortable that she can't handle it. And I don't. I want to be honest and yet I feel there are some areas that I don't even accept. Mm-hmm. And if you can't accept them in yourself, how could you possibly be comfortable in telling them to her? Right. Mm-hmm. And yet, as you say, you do have these desires and you do have your feelings, but you don't feel good about them. Right. And I have a feeling you're just going to sit there and let me stew on it like I want more. I want you to help me get rid of my guilt feeling. If I can get rid of my guilt feeling about lying or going to bed with a single woman. Any of that. Just so I can feel more comfortable. Mm-hmm. And I guess I'd like to say, no, I don't want to let you just stew in your feelings. But on the other hand, I also feel that this is the kind of very private thing that I couldn't possibly answer for you. But I sure as anything will try to help you work toward your own answer. I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but I mean it. Well, I appreciate you saying that. You sound like you mean it. But I don't know where to go. I don't begin to know where to go. But I've pretty well worked over most of my guilt. And now that this is coming up, I'm disappointed in myself. Mm-hmm. I really am. I like it when I feel that no matter what I do, even if it's against my own morals or my upbringing, that I can still feel good about me. And now I don't. Like there's a girl at work who sort of mothers me. And she just, I think she thinks I'm all sweet. And I sure don't want to show my more ornery, devilish side with her. I want to be sweet. And it's so hard for me to, this all seems so new again. Mm-hmm. I'm learning. Yeah, I get the disappointment that here, a lot of these things you thought you'd worked through, and now the guilt's in a feeling that only a part of you is acceptable to anybody else. Yes. That keeps coming out. I guess I do catch the real deep puzzlement that you feel as to what the hell shall I do? What can I do? Yes, and you know what I can find, Doctor, is that everything I start to do that I impulse, it seems natural to tell Pam here or to go out on a date or something. I'm comfortable until I think how I was affected as a child. And the minute that comes up, then I'm all haywire. Mm-hmm. Like I want to be a good mother so bad, and I feel like I am a good mother. Mm-hmm. But then there's those little exceptions. Mm-hmm. Like my guilt's with working. I want to work, and it's so fun having extra money. I like to work nights. The minute I think I'm not being real good to the children or giving them enough time, then I start feeling guilty again. Then that's when I'm, it's a, what do they call it? A double bind. That's just what it feels like. Mm-hmm. I want to do this, and it feels right, but I don't know how to do it. Mm-hmm. But after all, I'm not being a good mother, and I want to be both. Mm-hmm. I'm becoming more and more aware of what a perfectionist I am. That's what it seems like. I want to be so perfect. Either I want to become perfect, in my standards, or not have that need anymore. Or I guess I hear it a little differently that what you want is to seem perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. Mm-hmm. And you want to be perfect. And you want to be perfect.
