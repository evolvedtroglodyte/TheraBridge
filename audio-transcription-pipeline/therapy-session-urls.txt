# ARCHIVED: ROLE-PLAY DEMONSTRATIONS (REMOVED)
# =====================================================
# The following URLs were part of the original download but were
# filtered out on December 19, 2025 due to being educational
# role-plays/demonstrations rather than real therapy sessions.
#
# Files deleted: 30 (27 role-plays + 1 duplicate + 1 processed output + 1 re-evaluated)
# Space freed: 141 MB
# Reason: Dataset filtered to retain only authentic therapy sessions
#
# If role-play demonstrations are needed for educational comparison,
# these URLs remain available but are commented out for current pipeline testing.
